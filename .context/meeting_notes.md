# Meeting Notes - Sprint 26 Planning

**Date:**
**Attendees:** Pooja Reddy (Lead), Amit Kumar, Intern

---

## Document approval workflow FSM

- **Pooja Reddy:** This is blocking our release. Amit Kumar started the work but got reassigned. @Intern, take this ticket and fix the bugs identified in code review.

- **Amit Kumar:** The core structure is correct but there are two known bugs. Check the PR comments for details. The first issue is the more critical one.

## Action Items

- [ ] @Intern - Fix bugs in `ApprovalWorkflow.java` and `StateTransition.java`
- [ ] @Amit Kumar - Code review when PR is ready
- [ ] @Pooja Reddy - Final sign-off before merge
